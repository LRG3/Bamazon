# Bamazon
Bamazon is an app that will take orders from customers and deplete stock from a store's inventory using MySql and Node. The app will ask for the product ID that is generated next to the item on the screen. Bamazon will then ask how many units the customer would like to order. Once the customer has placed the order, the app will check the store's inventory and confirm that the product is in stock. If there is not enough inventory, Bamazon will generate a message "Sorry, there's not enough in stock!". If there is a current amount of stock, Bamazon will caculate the customer's grand total and let them know the items will be shipped in 3 to 5 business days. 

Once shopping for that item is complete, Bamazon will ask if you would like to purchase another item. If Y is entered, the app is repromted. If N is entered, the message "See you soon!" will generate.
